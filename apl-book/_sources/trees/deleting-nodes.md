# Deleting Nodes

We saw previously a way to select sub-trees of a tree with a mask. For instance given the following tree:

```{code-cell}
p←1 7 4 1 7 6 3 7 6 1
(⍳≢p) PPV p
```

Say we want to delete node $3$ and all of its descendants. We can mask all nodes which are node $3$ or one of its descendents using a method we've seen before.

```{code-cell}
⊢mask←3=p I@{⍵≠3}⍣≡⍳≢p
mask PPV p
```

The first step will be to remove node $3$ and its descendents from the parent vector using this mask.

```{code-cell}
(~mask)/p
```

Like so many times before, we're now left with parent pointers which need correcting. In the original `p`, a certain number of to-be-deleted nodes may have appeared before each node which was not deleted. After deleting the sub-tree, each node is therefore that many places farther back in the vector, and we need to correct the pointers to reflect that.

For instance, there are $3$ nodes which we will remove that appear before node $7$ in `p`, so when the nodes are removed, node $7$ will move to index $7-3=4$, and we need to update parent pointers accordingly.

```
index:     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
p:         1 7 4 1 7 6 3 7 6 1
mask:      0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
                 ↑   ↑ ↑ ↑
  to-be-deleted ─┴───┴─┘ │
                   ┌─────┘
                   ↓
(~mask)/p: 1 7 4 7 7 1
```

We saw a similar situation when we were [extracting trees from forests](forests.md#deforestation), where parent pointers were offset too far. In that instance, we found the offsets to correct by with a `+\` on the mask of deleted nodes. We can use the same technique here, but for completeness, we're going to show another way[^performance].

[^performance]: Additionally, I ran some performance tests and found that the scan technique was faster for deforesting, while the technique described here was faster for the general task of deleting sub-trees.

Firstly, let's find the indices of all the nodes being deleted.

```{code-cell}
⍸mask
```

These indices define intervals, within which we know how many to-be-deleted nodes have appeared. For example, we know that $3$ such nodes appear before node $7$.

```{code-cell}
  1+(⍸mask)⍸7    ⍝ 3 to-be-deleted nodes appear before node 7
⍝ ││└───────┴───── in which interval does node 7 appear
⍝ └┴────────────── using ⎕IO←0 means we have to make this adjustment
```

This tells us exactly what to subtract in order to correct each parent pointer.

```{code-cell}
q←(~mask)/p          ⍝ delete unwanted nodes
  1+(⍸mask)⍸q        ⍝ deleted nodes appearing before each parent
q-1+(⍸mask)⍸q        ⍝ correcting the pointers
```

This correctly removes the whole sub-tree descending from node $3$.

```{code-cell}
((~mask)/⍳≢p) PPV q-1+(⍸mask)⍸q
```

We can put this all together into a tacit idiom we can easily reuse.

```{code-cell}
    (⍸mask)(⊢-1+⍸)(~mask)/p
PPV (⍸mask)(⊢-1+⍸)(~mask)/p
```
