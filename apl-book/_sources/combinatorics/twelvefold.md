# The Twelvefold Way

- three variables:
    - labelling of balls
    - labelling of boxes
    - at most 1 ball, at least one ball, or any number of balls
- problems conceptually in a `2 2 3` array
- richard stanley and that other guy
- twelvefold table, partially filled in with already seen problems
- we're going to explore the rest of the problems, and enumerate possibilities for each



## Implementing the Twelvefold Way

- for each function, we can either have ball → box mappings, or box → ball mappings, or both!
- for more information
    - sudley place for nars2000 apl stuff
    - taocp4a for imperative generation algorithms - we're doing recursive implementations
- permutation function from aplcart
