    "Suppose each character of this string corresponds to a box. Wherever a `0` appears, we leave the box empty. Wherever a `1` appears, we place a ball in the box. Each box represents an element of the original set, and placing a ball in the box represents selecting that element to be included in a combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing to notice about this analogy is this: the boxes are *labelled*, while the balls are *unlabelled*. Exactly which ball a box gets doesn't matter, since the balls are indistinguishable. However, which box a ball is placed in does matter, since that dictates which element of the set is chosen. In this sense, the boxes are labelled with the elements of the set.\n",

    "This setup gives us an alternative statement of the combination problem: there are `k!n` ways to place $k$ unlabelled balls into $n$ labelled boxes, with at most one ball in each box.\n",

    "In isolation this is not particularly enlightening, but things get more interesting when we notice that we can tweak the parameters of the problem in three different ways. We can change whether the balls are labelled, whether the boxes are labelled, and how many balls are allowed in each box. This gives way to a whole family of counting problems, and we'll be categorising them all in the next chapter. For now, let's see how changing just one part of the problem effects things.\n",
    "\n",

We're also going to look at how controlling the number of balls which can go into each box affects the problems we make, which is going to require being more formal with our analogy.\n",

    "Consider again the balls and boxes example we've just seen. It involves assigning a box to each ball we have. In other words, each placement of balls is equivalent to a monadic function which takes a ball as input, and returns the box it is placed in as output. We've been working with our fruit example until now, but to show how our problems can work for any set, we're going to start using generic sets of inputs and outputs. This is not quite as fun but it helps to forget about the details of examples and just think about the counting itself. Specifically, we'll just use `‚ç≥k` as our $k$ element input set (our 'balls'), and `‚ç≥n` as our $n$ element output set (our 'boxes') from now on. In traditional mathematical notation, this means we're working with functions $f$ with type $f:[k]\\to[n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $k$ and $n$, there are `n*k` possible functions from `‚ç≥k` to `‚ç≥n` (functions with type $[k]\\to[n]$), since there are $n$ options for each of the $k$ inputs. However, our counting problems usually have fewer valid assignments than this. For example, in our $k$-permutations problem, we only allowed at most one ball to be placed in each box, which means any function that places two or more balls in the same box isn't counted."

    "This shows that in our counting problems which require at most one ball in a box, we are really counting *injective* functions, i.e. functions which which don't send more than one element of the input to the same output.

    "We can also think about what counting *surjective* functions, that is, functions where each element of `‚ç≥n` has at least one element of `‚ç≥k` which is sent to it, means for our counting problems. In the balls and boxes analogy, it means that each box gets *at least* one ball placed in it, potentially more.
