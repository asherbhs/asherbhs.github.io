    "In this section, we're going to encounter one of the most basic and useful concepts in combinatorics: *combinations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *combination* is a selection distinct elements from a set, without repetition, where we don't care about the order we pick elements. For example, given the set `'🍎🍌🍊🍐🍇'`, `'🍎🍌🍊'` is a combination of $3$ elements from the set. It is different to the combination `'🍎🍌🍇'`, but the same as the combination `'🍊🍌🍎'`, since we don't care about order. A *$k$-combination* is a combination of exactly $k$ elements from the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $10$ $3$-combinations of our set `'🍎🍌🍊🍐🍇'`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "🍎🍌🍊\n",
    "🍎🍌🍐\n",
    "🍎🍌🍇\n",
    "🍎🍊🍐\n",

    "🍌🍊🍐\n",
    "🍌🍊🍇\n",
    "🍌🍐🍇\n",
    "🍊🍐🍇\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably clear where we're going with this. If we have a set of $n$ elements, how many $k$-combinations of elements from that set are there? This is very similar to a question we've already answered. We've already seen that there are `(!n)÷!n-k` $k$-*permutations* of an $n$ element set, so this is a good starting point. There are more $k$-permutations of a set than there are $k$-combinations of the same set, since the order that we select elements matters in a permutation, but not in combinations: `'🍏🍊'` and `'🍊🍏'` are the same combination of items, but they are different permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there are $60$ $3$-permutations of `'🍎🍌🍊🍐🍇'`, which we can group by which $3$-combinations they are equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "🍎🍌🍊  🍎🍌🍐  🍎🍊🍐  🍌🍊🍐  🍎🍌🍇  🍎🍊🍇  🍌🍊🍇  🍎🍐🍇  🍌🍐🍇  🍊🍐🍇\n",
    "🍎🍊🍌  🍎🍐🍌  🍎🍐🍊  🍌🍐🍊  🍎🍇🍌  🍎🍇🍊  🍌🍇🍊  🍎🍇🍐  🍌🍇🍐  🍊🍇🍐\n",
    "🍌🍎🍊  🍌🍎🍐  🍊🍎🍐  🍊🍌🍐  🍌🍎🍇  🍊🍎🍇  🍊🍌🍇  🍐🍎🍇  🍐🍌🍇  🍐🍊🍇\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $3$-combination, we can see that there are `!3 ←→ 6` $3$-permutations of that combination's elements. In general, for each $k$-combination of items, there are `!k` permutations of that combination. So, in our formula `(!n)÷!n-k` for counting $k$-permutations, we are overcounting combinations by a factor of `!k`. This leads us to a formula for the number of $k$-combinations:\n",
